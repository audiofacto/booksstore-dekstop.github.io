So, to search imput you book in the search box. See, carefully that it shows in bracket like this-(link-1). It means that you have to click link one to get the particular book or whatever you are searching for it shows a different result. You might have faced a problem like- Where and how can I get the links?
 TO do this click on details option near it.
